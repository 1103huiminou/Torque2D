baseProject is a template for starting a Torque2D game from scratch.

1. Copy this "baseProject" directory to wherever you want to create the project.
2. copy the following files from your Torque2D original source to your copy of baseProject:
	* OpenAL32.dll
	* unicows.dll

3a) copy the engine into "baseProject" as well.
  To do this you may need to obtain or compile a copy.  Either
	* copy the game engine Torque2D.exe (for Windows) or Torque2D.app (for Mac OSX). Or
	* compile the original (or modified) Torque2D engine.  Then copy it.
3b) alternatively you may want to copy the original (or modified) "engine" directory  to "baseProject" and build and modify your copy as part of this project.
