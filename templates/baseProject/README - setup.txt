baseProject is a template for starting a Torque2D game from scratch.

1. Copy this "baseProject" directory to wherever you want to create the project.  This becomes the main project directory.
2. If you are running Windows, copy the following files from your Torque2D original source to your copy of baseProject:
	* OpenAL32.dll
	* unicows.dll
3. Copy the engine into "baseProject" as well.  To do this you may need to obtain or compile a copy.  Either
	* compile the original Torque2D engine if you have not.
	* Then copy it here.  It will be named Torque2D.exe (for Windows) or Torque2D.app (for Mac OSX).
3b. Alternatively you may want to copy the original "engine" directory here, and then build and modify your copy as part of this project.
